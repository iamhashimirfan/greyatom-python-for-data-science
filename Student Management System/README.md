### Project Overview

 You have been hired by the University of Data Science to manage their students' records. Your job is to create the student management system for the university. Let's try to build the system using basic Python operations.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I got to know how to solve basic Python problems. In this project, I applied the following concepts:

-Mathematical operations

-List operations

-Dictionary operations

-String indexing and formatting

### Instructions

Step 1: Let's create a new register by combining data from two classes while making some modifications to the register.

Step 2: Let's create a dictionary for Geoffrey Hinton in each subject to generate his progress report.

Step 3: For the student who got the highest marks in this subject, the school has decided to award a scholarship. Let's check who performed best in mathematics from all the students who appeared for the test.

Step 4: From the previous task, we know who is the 'Maths' topper in the class. You now have to print the name of the student on the certificate, but you will have to print his last name and then his first name.
